        "In this notebook, we will help you to develop models for your experiments. But this time, next to completing the notebook, **you are expected to write a four-page scientific report with your findings**. Please still submit the notebook together with your scientific report so that we can reproduce your experiments. (Note: if you find it useful, you can split this notebook into multiple notebooks. If you do so, keep it mind that it should be possible for your TAs to reproduce the entire content of the notebooks without having to ask for clarifications or to copy and paste functions from one sub-notebook to another.) Make sure your code corresponds to the description you give in the report; we will deduct points if this is not the case.\n",

        "In Practical 1, a review consisted of several sentences, and we had one sentiment score for the whole review. Now, a review consists of a single sentence, and we have a sentiment score for each node in the binary tree that makes up the sentence, including the root node (i.e., we still have an overall sentiment score for the entire review). We will look at an example below.\n",

In practice, if your model overfits, this means that it will be very good at predicting (or \"remembering\") the sentiment of the training set, but unable to generalise to new, unseen data in the test set. This is undesirable and one technique to mitigate this issue is *dropout*.\n",

Which parameters we drop is stochastically determined by a Bernoulli distribution and the probability of each parameter being dropped is set to $p = 0.5$ in our experiments (see the previous cell of code where we define our output layer). A dropout layer can be applied at many different places in our models. This technique helps against the undesirable effect that a model relies on single parameters for prediction (e.g. if $h^{\\prime}_j$ is large, always predict positive). If we use dropout, the model needs to learn to rely on different parameters, which is desirable to obtain better generalisation to unseen data."

        "- Do you get better performance if you supervise the sentiment **at each node in the tree**? You can extract more training examples by treating every node in each tree as a separate tree. You will need to write a function that extracts all subtrees given a treestring.\n",

However, the report needs to remain fully self-contained: the appendix should only include content that is not necessary to understand your work. For example, preprocessing decisions, model parameters, pseudocode, sample system inputs/outputs, and other details that are necessary for the exact replication of your work can be put into the appendix.\n",

        "- Results visually well-presented and described with the correct priority of importance of sub-results\n",
